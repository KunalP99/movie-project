A movie database website allowing users to keep track of movies they want to watch and movies they have watched. The website will keep users informed about the latest and most popular movies. To make this application stand out, I am introducing a gamification feature that will enable users to earn points and unlock achievements based on the number of movies they have watched.

## Demo
This project is not yet finished, but this video is a demo of the current state of the project.

## Current Features
- Watchlist - Users can add movies to a watchlist
- Search - Users can search for a movie by typing into the input box
- History - Users can add movies to their history list and edit/delete from the list
- Points - Users can earn points based on the movies in their History list
- Authentication - Users can log in to the application through their Gmail account using Google ([OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2))
- Users are shown the trending and latest movies in the homepage

## Future Features
- Gamification
  * Achievements - Earn achievements based on certain criteria‚Äôs (e.g., Watch 20 movies) 
- Profile - Users will have their own profile which will show various information and which they can customise with the points they earn
- Cast Profile - Actors/Actresses will have their own page to show relevant information about them
- Top Stars - Show the most popular actors/actresses 

## API's
- I am using the The Movie Database API ([TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) to access all movie information on the website
- For authentication, I am using [Google OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) 
- [React-Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) - Handles notification popups
